GitHub Webhook Logger

This project sets up an AWS infrastructure to log details of GitHub webhook events using an API Gateway, Lambda function, S3 bucket, and CloudWatch for monitoring. The Lambda function is triggered by GitHub webhooks, processes the event data, and stores the logs in an S3 bucket.

Project Overview:

* API Gateway: Handles HTTP requests from GitHub webhooks.
* Lambda Function: Processes the incoming webhook data, identifies the changed files in a pull request, and logs this data.
* Lambda Layer: Includes dependencies for the Lambda function.
* S3 Bucket: Stores the logs generated by the Lambda function.
* CloudWatch: Monitors and logs activities for both the API Gateway and Lambda function.

Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies for the Lambda layer using pip and package them.
3. Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform: terraform init, terraform apply.
4. Configure your GitHub repository to send webhook events to the API Gateway endpoint.
5. Monitor the API Gateway and Lambda function logs in CloudWatch.
6. Logs of the processed GitHub webhook events will be stored in the specified S3 bucket.
